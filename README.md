## Notice
The upgrade from v1.0.27 to v1.1.0 resulted in a save file imcompatability for custom achievements. Download [this GUI](https://github.com/timenoe/Terraria-RetroAchievements-Save-Converter/releases/download/v1/save_converter.zip) to convert your save file to the new format to keep progress.

## Restrictions
- No Journey Mode
- No Celebrationmk10 Seed

## Notes
Items that are exclusive to difficulties and special seeds are excluded, so that all achievements can be obtained in standard playthroughs. The World Achievements mod adds achievements for all difficulties and seed-specific items.
